Sunshine Weather App for SE Project

This weather app was created for a college project. 
The design scheme was taken from Google's Develop Android Applications course from Udacity. 
The weather API was provided by www.apixu.com
The application icon was provided by pixel perfect from www.flaticons.com

The project was completed in a hurry. So at some places, the best practices were not followed. But, I spent a lot of time on this. And learnt a lot. Never stop learning!!!
